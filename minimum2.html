    <p class="small-heading">Introduction</p>
    <p class="project-description">Minimum, a YC-backed emissions data platform, approached me to rebrand their company as part of a broader strategy to establish themselves as market leaders in carbon accounting. Their mission centres on giving organisations total visibility over their carbon emissions, helping them achieve their Net Zero goals.</p>

    <p class="small-heading">Background</p>
    <p class="project-description">I worked with the team to understand who they were and what they wanted to deliver to their customers. From this we established some brand pillars with which we could build Minimum’s brand. </p>

    <p class="small-heading">A Rule of Six</p>
    <p class="project-description">Early in the branding process, I built a concept around the number 6. Six is the atomic number of carbon, an element with six protons, neutrons, and electrons. This connection felt intuitive, grounding the brand in the scientific foundations of the carbon atom itself and bringing forward the idea of counting each element.</p>
    <p class="project-description">This idea came to life through an abacus-inspired logo system and abstract patterns that subtly reinforce Minimum’s role in “counting the invisible.”</p>

  <section class="container-text">
    <p class="project-description">To deliver on Minimum’s vision, I created a clean, modern design language that strikes a balance between science and simplicity. The color palette was carefully chosen to convey trust, accountability, and professionalism, essential qualities for a brand in carbon data. The brand needed to appeal to both large corporations and startups focused on managing their environmental impact.</p>

    <p class="small-heading">Logo & Type</p>
    <p class="project-description">The logotype was crafted by drawing a customised version of “Minimum” from Alliance No. 1 by the Degarism type foundry. I chose this typeface for its sharp angles and ink-traps that suggest precision but still add character to the space.</p>
    <p class="project-description">The monospaced version of the same typeface allowed the numeric elements of the brand to visually echo the data-driven calculations at the heart of Minimum’s platform.</p>

    <p class="small-heading">Deliverables</p>
    <p class="project-description">My final deliverables for this project included a comprehensive brand guidelines document alongside a set of updated messaging.</p>
    <p class="project-description">In the document I went to lengths to explain the output, talking about the colour choices, using the grid, the “Rule of Six” and how to utilise a series of background patterns I’d developed for the brand.</p>

    <p class="project-description">Passionate about making reproductive healthcare accessible to everyone, Fertifa is the UK’s leading benefits provider in a rapidly emerging market. I collaborated closely with Fertifa to define their brand, values, and voice in a way that set them apart in a field with only a few competitors, ensuring they stood out to general consumers, partner businesses, and industry clients.</p>

    <p class="project-description">With a blank slate, I worked alongside Fertifa to develop a cohesive strategy, brand identity, and digital experience that communicated their mission. This included uncovering Fertifa’s core values and aligning them with a visual and verbal identity that would resonate across audiences. The collaborative process led to a design language that reflected Fertifa’s compassionate, detail-oriented approach, helping them establish a strong and unique presence in the healthcare space.</p>

    <p class="project-description">From day one, we agreed on the need to create a set of solid, foundational values that would guide the brand’s direction. These principles reflected Fertifa’s sensitive, “helping hand” approach to reproductive health—a message that needed to come through across all brand touchpoints. With an emphasis on professionalism, care, and timeless appeal, I avoided current market trends, opting instead for a brand identity that would endure as the company grew. This strategy informed every element, from the color palette to the messaging framework.</p>

    <p class="project-description">After several rounds of collaboration, I delivered a complete brand package in time for Fertifa’s business relaunch. This included a fresh visual identity, a precise tone of voice, and an accessible digital experience, all anchored by our “care first” strategy and newly defined brand pillars. The logomark I designed symbolized health, care, the letter “f,” and the growth of new life—a visual that now acts as Fertifa’s recognizable stamp in reproductive healthcare.</p>

    <p class="project-description">The brand’s primary color, known internally as “blurple,” combines boldness with approachability, while paired-back secondary tones represent Fertifa’s different support pathways, establishing a versatile and cohesive design system.</p>

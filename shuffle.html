    <p class="project-description">In late 2023, I joined Shuffle, a new style of rewards app that offers users random cashback as they visit local restaurants. The goal of my involvement was to help Shuffle define their brand and product from the ground up. Establishing themselves in this highly competitive field, whilst preparing for a successful market launch. Over the course of a year, I worked closely with Shuffle’s founding team to set a strategic direction that allowed them to launch their first product six months ahead of schedule whilst securing partnerships with over 15 restaurant groups across Manchester.</p>

    <p class="project-description">As I was starting from scratch, I focused on creating a cohesive brand identity and product experience that would appeal to Shuffle’s unique audience—users looking to discover new dining spots while receiving cashback rewards. In doing so, I helped the brand uncover who their Super Specific Who was and ensured that the brand’s visual language, product design, and initial marketing materials were designed to help build recognition and trust among users and restaurant partners alike.</p>

    <p class="project-description">I established a complete brand identity, including logo design, colour palette, and a brand tone that spoke to the excitement of rewards and discovery. Alongside the visual identity, I built a design system from the ground up, creating a suite of standardised components that have ensured consistency across Shuffle’s design and development teams. This design system provides a scalable framework that has made it easy for the team to keep the brand cohesive as they look to add new features and refine the user experience.</p>

    <p class="project-description">For the product itself, I designed all of the user flows and interfaces throughout the app to help emphasise Shuffle’s unique and random cashback rewards. The design made it easy for users to discover new restaurants, track their rewards, and enjoy a seamless experience from signup to cash-out.</p>

    <p class="project-description">My work with Shuffle was clearly focussed on bringing them from zero-to-one, which is where they are now. Exactly one year after I joined, Shuffle have a product in the market, and are ready to launch to the wider public.</p>

    <p class="project-description">Beyond brand and product work, I was instrumental in developing marketing assets and presentations that helped Shuffle secure partnerships and attract investment. This approach helped them land critical restaurant partners and raise an additional £2 million in funding.</p>

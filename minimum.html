    <p class="project-description">Minimum, a YC-backed emissions data platform, approached me to rebrand their company as part of a broader strategy to establish themselves as leaders in carbon accounting. Their mission centers on giving organizations total visibility over their carbon emissions, helping them achieve Net Zero goals.</p>

    <p class="project-description">To deliver on Minimum’s vision, I created a clean, modern design language that strikes a balance between science and simplicity. The color palette was carefully chosen to convey trust, accountability, and professionalism, essential qualities for a brand in carbon data. The brand needed to appeal to both large corporations and startups focused on managing their environmental impact.</p>

    <p class="project-description">Early in the process, I decided to base the brand concept around the number 6, the atomic number of carbon, which has six protons, neutrons, and electrons. This connection felt intuitive, grounding the brand in the scientific foundations of carbon itself. I brought this idea to life through an abacus-inspired logo system and abstract patterns that subtly reinforce Minimum’s role in “counting the invisible.”</p>

    <p class="project-description">The rebranding effort successfully positioned Minimum as a trusted name in emissions data management. My final deliverables included a comprehensive brand guidelines document and updated messaging. The logotype was crafted from a customized version of Alliance No. 1 by Degarism type foundry, chosen for its sharp angles and ink-traps that suggest precision. The monospaced version allowed the numeric elements of the type to visually echo the data-driven calculations at the heart of Minimum’s platform.</p>

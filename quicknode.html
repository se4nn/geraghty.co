    <p class="project-description">From day one, I collaborated with QuickNode’s product team to redesign their MVP with scalability in mind. As the project evolved, I incorporated user feedback to refine features and worked strategically to ensure that QuickNode’s design could support their rapid growth and long-term ambitions.</p>

    <p class="project-description">My work focused on expanding QuickNode’s existing design language while developing a comprehensive design system that the team could build on well beyond my involvement. This design system standardized essential components, creating a cohesive look and feel that could scale with the product and support new features. As part of my year-long engagement, I helped QuickNode establish an internal design function to carry forward and expand on the work we had started. Since my time with QuickNode, they have raised two additional funding rounds, including a recent $35 million investment led by Tiger, valuing the company at $250 million.</p>

    <p class="project-description">QuickNode was my first entry into Web 3.0, where I quickly gained an understanding of blockchain infrastructure and its importance for scalable applications. This knowledge enabled me to create a design framework that supported QuickNode’s mission, empowering users to tap into a robust infrastructure crucial for building in the decentralized space.</p>
